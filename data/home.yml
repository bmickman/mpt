    Schedule your last minute piano tuning needs in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, or the greater metro NYC area today!   
    Hello! My name is Brandon and I'm a long-term New York City resident. I've been tuning New York's
    pianos since 2011. I've worked on many of the most famous stages in the world, such as 
    Carnegie Hall, The Apollo, Lincoln Center, Saint Patrick's Cathedral, and several theaters on (and off) Broadway! 
  </p>

  <p>  
    I've tuned at some of the most highly regarded recording studios in the city, as well as
    for NYC public and private schools, churches, and countless home residences. 
    I've also tuned specifically for performances by Sarah McLachlan, Alicia Keys, Hugh Jackman, and for plays such as The Book of Mormon and Shucked.
